1. go on the notes that eyal dictate for us for the project and for the general instructions for the project {there is no check box because these are instructions and not an actual step in the process}

2. implement the profile include frontend ( X ) :

3. implement the chat as basic as it can be ( x ) : 

4. decide if game gonna be just one main and only hero or keep as ai chat bot for dnd ( x ) :
    more simple chatbot , only three game style - maybe i'll add more in the future .( X + ?)

5. focus and specify the chat and web site ( Adding AI-extra 10 points !()! ) : 
    - ***try focus first on making a "pro" website .***
    - make change password in a different component + add link in login for change password component for "forgot your password? click here" - after successfull password change redirect to login page.
    - send varifaction code to the email + check if the code is correct + change the password - after successfull implementing basic password change redirect to login page
    - fix full gemini integration ai with the neccesary data to create game mechanics (races , spells , equipment , monsters , game styles maybe fireball too)
        chatbot_model.py was successfully split to blueprints , and chatbot as in the same chat error but integrated well to the gen_txt
        i think its better becuase it didnt worked as i wanted it to or well, maybe i should try again with a different approach .
    - maybe instead of using the MongoDB compass either find a way to connect to Atlas or use Atlas cluster directly OR use a different no sql DB like          firebase - work better with Gemini but will cost more to remember how to connect to it correctly and potentially more expensive .()

       it seems there is a problem with the connection between the django and the angular

    - sending emails (3 extra points each).
    - Using unit test (extra 3 points). 

7. design the website first edition ( X ) :

            In the future, this functionality will be removed. Please add this polyfill in the "polyfills" section of your "angular.json" instead. - fix this so it wont be a problem for the docker to build in the future or create a malfuction container .

9.b. security measures ( ) :
    - add a security measure to the loggers so they dont show the full path to the file and just the name of the file .
    - add a sort of notification system to that monitor al loggers and use a real time db that send all logs data either to an portable hard drive or to the cloud or to a sdd card .
    - improve logger more , and make them even more organised readable , send all Werkzeug in to different folder - for kind of Werkzeug messages , excluding the framework cmd temrinal logger Werzeug startup messages.
    - add more sections if u think its needed .

1. go on the notes that eyal dictate for us for the project and for the general instructions for the project {there is no check box because these are instructions and not an actual step in the process}

2. implement the profile include frontend ( X ) :

3. implement the chat as basic as it can be ( x ) : 

4. decide if game gonna be just one main and only hero or keep as ai chat bot for dnd ( x ) :
    more simple chatbot , only three game style - maybe i'll add more in the future .()

5. focus and specify the chat and web site ( ) : 
    - make change password in a different component + add link in login for change password component for "forgot your password? click here"   
    - fix superuser profile 
    - fix full gemini integration ai with the neccesary data to create game mechanics (races , spells , equipment , monsters , game styles maybe fireball too)
        maybe chatbot_model should be seperated to different files and classes to be more organized and maybe it will work better - sort of a bulk of blueprints for the chatbot to work, becuase until now it was only at a file called chatbot_model.py , so maybe it will be better to have a class for each game mechanic and then ai can use all of them to create the game mechanics for the chatbot. 
        i think its better becuase it didnt worked as i wanted it to or well, maybe i should try again with a different approach .
    - maybe instead of using the MongoDB compass either find a way to connect to Atlas or use Atlas cluster directly OR use a different no sql DB like          firebase - work better with Gemini but will cost more to remember how to connect to it correctly and potentially more expensive .()

6. create unit tests for all API calls ( ) :

7. design the website first edition ( X ) :

8. implemnt and finish the dockers ( ) :

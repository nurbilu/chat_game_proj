        chatbot_model.py was successfully split to blueprints , and chatbot as in the same chat error but integrated well to the gen_txt
        i think its better becuase it didnt worked as i wanted it to or well, maybe i should try again with a different approach .
    - maybe instead of using the MongoDB compass either find a way to connect to Atlas or use Atlas cluster directly OR use a different no sql DB like          firebase - work better with Gemini but will cost more to remember how to connect to it correctly and potentially more expensive .()

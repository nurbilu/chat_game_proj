Please include :admin credentials in the README.md 


1. go on the notes that eyal dictate for us for the project and for the general instructions for the project {there is no check box because these are instructions and not an actual step in the process}
link for the instructions: 
https://johnbryce.echo.timetoknow.com/index.html#/$/library/%/notifications/isInboxExpanded/true/selectedFolder/inbox/selectedId/bb108327-b16f-49f9-b306-6f1661278239/$/echoPlayer/params/channelId=b287fb37-468c-4f55-9734-d2f73f7ebbbe&clk=vKuInfU1/page/11e5cd79-a99c-40ef-9c71-4e96850f0de9
 
2. implement the profile include frontend ( X ) :

3. implement the chat as basic as it can be ( x ) : 

4. decide if game gonna be just one main and only hero or keep as ai chat bot for dnd ( x ) :
    more simple chatbot , only three game style - maybe i'll add more in the future .( X + ?)

5. focus and specify the chat and web site ( Adding AI-extra 10 points !()! ) : 
    - ***try focus first on making a "pro" website .***
    - send varifaction code to the email + check if the code is correct + change the password - after successfull implementing basic password change redirect to login page
    - fix full gemini integration ai with the neccesary data to create game mechanics (races , spells , equipment , monsters , game styles maybe fireball too)
        chatbot_model.py was successfully split to blueprints , and chatbot as in the same chat error but integrated well to the gen_txt
        i think its better becuase it didnt worked as i wanted it to or well, maybe i should try again with a different approach .
    - maybe instead of using the MongoDB compass either find a way to connect to Atlas or use Atlas cluster directly OR use a different no sql DB like          firebase - work better with Gemini but will cost more to remember how to connect to it correctly and potentially more expensive .()
    - incrypt pwd_user_str data that only when superuser is logged in and ask for a password to decrypt the pwd_user_str data and display for superuser both (backend & frontend)
    - add a DnD and game info library - contain all the data needed for the game mechanics , same component but in a table with select and search input box (races , spells , equipment , monsters , game styles and more if seems needed or found something more to add).
    -""if have more functions or some other ideas to enrich the projet when submitting and also for the future to real users to use."" .

6. create unit tests for all API calls ( bonus 6 points - could help and wont hurt - ( ) - see if have time to implement) :
    - sending emails (3 extra points each).
    - Using unit test (extra 3 points). 

7. design the website first edition ( X ) :


8. finish design part two/second edition or more , make it responsive as it can be and some git additions( ) : 
    - using ng-bootstrap+bootstrap to finish the responsiveness of the website : 
        1. make the toast messages more responsive , display the username when login(half done) .
            also , customize toast messages of the other components
        2. fix navbar for superuser , when is true ,profile will show super - profile . 
        2. angular : incrypt pwd_user_str data that only when superuser is logged in and ask for a password to decrypt the pwd_user_str data and display for superuser .
    - Responsive (using MUI extra 2 points)
    - add to readme.md terminals commands to run the project 

9.a. implemnt and finish the dockers ( ) :
    (Dockerfile ( bonus + 10 points! ))
    - fix before build : 
        - â–² [WARNING] Polyfill for "@angular/localize/init" was added automatically. [plugin angular-polyfills]
            In the future, this functionality will be removed. Please add this polyfill in the "polyfills" section of your "angular.json" instead. - fix this so it wont be a problem for the docker to build in the future or create a malfuction container .

9.b. security measures ( ) :
    - add a security measure to the loggers so they dont show the full path to the file and just the name of the file .
    - add a sort of notification system to that monitor al loggers and use a real time db that send all logs data either to an portable hard drive or to the cloud or to a sdd card .
    - improve logger more , and make them even more organised readable , send all Werkzeug in to different folder - for kind of Werkzeug messages , excluding the framework cmd temrinal logger Werzeug startup messages.
    - add more sections if u think its needed .
    



10. cloud deployment ( ) :
    not a must project wise , but will make the game more wide spread a fast reactions and prompts 
    - deploy on the cloud firebase ?

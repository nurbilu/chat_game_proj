  - Configure Docker to run TensorFlow, Django, and Angular in separate containers for development.

## 3. Backend Development (Django)
- **Setup Django Project:**
  - Initialize a new Django project if not already done.
  - Add required packages to `requirements.txt`.
- **Configure Settings:**
  - Update `settings.py` to include necessary configurations for installed apps, middleware, database settings, and other configurations as per the uploaded `settings.py`.
- **Define Models:**
  - Use the provided `models.py` to define the necessary database models.
  - Apply migrations to create database tables.
- **Create Serializers:**
  - Implement serializers for the models using the provided `serializers.py`.
- **Develop Forms:**
  - Implement necessary forms using the provided `forms.py`.
- **Create Views:**
  - Develop views to handle the business logic using the provided `views.py`.
- **Setup URLs:**
  - Define URL patterns in `urls.py` to route requests to appropriate views.
- **Configure Applications:**
  - Ensure the provided `apps.py` is configured correctly for application setup.

## 4. AI Model Development (TensorFlow)
- **AI Conceptualization:**
  - Define the scope of the AIâ€™s capabilities, including dynamic storytelling and natural language processing.
- **Model Training:**
  - Train a TensorFlow model for handling specific tasks like text generation, decision making, etc.
- **Integration with Django:**
  - Create an interface in Django to interact with the TensorFlow model for game narration and DM decisions.

## 5. Frontend Development (Angular)
- **Angular Project Setup:**
  - Initialize an Angular project configured to run within a Docker container.
- **UI/UX Design:**
  - Design a user-friendly interface for game interaction.
  - Implement responsive design for various devices.

## 6. Testing and Quality Assurance
- **Unit Testing:**
  - Write unit tests for backend API.
  - Write unit tests for AI interactions and responses.
  - Implement frontend unit tests for Angular components.
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Test the integration between all services (Django, TensorFlow, Angular, Firebase).
- **User Acceptance Testing:**
  - Conduct testing with potential users to gather feedback and refine the system.

## 7. Deployment
- **Docker Optimization:**
  - Optimize Docker containers for production.
- **Deployment Strategy:**

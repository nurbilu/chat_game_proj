### what to fix and errors : 
1.

2.if not refresh token - login regular and logout also when access token expired - check if expire (ck) - add toast message for token expiration does not work as expected , refresh token lifetime is 14 days but instead in the angular it expires in 6 minutes( :-/ ) , need to fix that - now refresh token is not working at all - login fails(done) - getting closer - login works but life is not -is according to access token.(:-/)

3.fix spell slot levels table duplication displayment in character create ()

4. set library - is set but needed to be properly worknig - check if make any errors or working unproperly - if so fix () :
   - make also search in library by partly name
   *|- tranform the data in tables to be more user friendly : remove ({[]}) from the data , organize data in ({[]}) for user to understand , for doing so i need to make functions that read/use only name if {dict} but if there is more than just name and url , only dont display url .| * 
   *|all refer the fact that all DB values are under "string" so need to change the way to display the data by considerong this| *
   - add sorting to the tables - 
   - try to fix the search result in the library - name is first(done) , *|and adjust array and objects to strings . ()| *
   *|- try to adjust all arrays and objects to strings - | *

   - make a template for the character creation - done.
   - fix Gemini integration - done.
   - make 5 templates for chat to make game gen quicker - 
   
6. make django framework more efficient - too many debug messages and many calls to each endpoints (?)()
6. b. change toast messages if error so toast contect "wrong action" or "wrong data" or "wrong username or password" or "wrong email or password" or "wrong username or email" or "wrong username or email or password" or "wrong username or email or password or address" or "wrong username or email or password or address or birthdate" or "wrong username or email or password or address or birthdate or first name or last name" or "wrong username or email or password or address or birthdate or first name or last name or profile picture" , if success toast message "action done successfully" or "data saved successfully" or "username or password correct" or "email or password correct" or "username or email correct" or "username or email or password correct" or "username or email or password or address correct" or "username or email or password or address or birthdate correct" or "username or email or password or address or birthdate or first name or last name correct" or "username or email or password or address or birthdate or first name or last name or profile picture correct" ()


### best for last : 
1. async problem - Uncaught (in promise) Error: A listener indicated an asynchronous response by returning true, but the message channel closed before a response was received - seems to show in all components few moments after reload(only if presists in the future ( )) 

2.  â–² [WARNING] Polyfill for "@angular/localize/init" was added automatically. [plugin angular-polyfills]
            In the future, this functionality will be removed. Please add this polyfill in the "polyfills" section of your "angular.json" instead. - fix this so it wont be a problem for the docker to build in the future or create a malfuction container .


3. [DOM] Found 2 elements with non-unique id #password: (More info: https://goo.gl/9p2vKq) 
   super-profile:1 [DOM] Found 2 elements with non-unique id #username: (More info: https://goo.gl/9p2vKq)  - check if this warning presists in the future and fix.

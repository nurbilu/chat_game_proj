The error message indicates that the email server rejected the username and password used for authentication. This is a common issue when trying to send emails via Google's SMTP server, especially when using a third-party application. Here's how you can resolve it:

### Steps to Fix the Issue:

1. **Enable "Less Secure Apps" or Use App Passwords**:
   - **Google no longer supports less secure apps directly**. Instead:
     - Turn on **2-Step Verification** for your Google account.
     - Create an **App Password** specific to your application. Use this password instead of your regular Google account password.
     - You can set this up via: [Google App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords).

2. **Check Your Credentials**:
   - Double-check the email and password in your code or configuration file. Ensure there are no typos or incorrect characters.

3. **SMTP Configuration**:
   - Ensure you are using the correct SMTP settings:
     ```
     SMTP Server: smtp.gmail.com
     Port: 587 (or 465 for SSL)
     Authentication: Required
     Encryption: TLS (or SSL for port 465)
     ```

4. **Review Security Settings**:
   - Visit your [Google Account Security page](https://myaccount.google.com/security).
   - Check for any security alerts that may have blocked the application.

5. **Review Email Sending Quota**:
   - If your app is sending a lot of emails, you may have exceeded the daily email quota. Free Gmail accounts have limits, so check your account usage.

6. **Check Logs for Additional Clues**:
   - The error includes a link for more details: [Google Support on Bad Credentials](https://support.google.com/mail/?p=BadCredentials). Read the guidance and adjust your configuration if needed.

7. **Test with an Email Client**:
   - Try setting up the email credentials in an email client (e.g., Outlook, Thunderbird). This helps verify that the credentials are correct and working.

8. **Code Example with Correct Settings**:
   If you're using Python with `smtplib`, here's an example of proper configuration:
   ```python
   import smtplib
   from email.mime.text import MIMEText

   sender_email = "your_email@gmail.com"
   app_password = "your_app_password"
   recipient_email = "nurb111@gmail.com"
   subject = "Test Email"
   body = "This is a test email."

   # Setup the MIME
   msg = MIMEText(body)
   msg['Subject'] = subject
   msg['From'] = sender_email
   msg['To'] = recipient_email

   try:
       # Connect to the server
       server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)
       server.starttls()  # Secure the connection
       server.login(sender_email, app_password)
       server.sendmail(sender_email, recipient_email, msg.as_string())
       print("Email sent successfully!")
   except Exception as e:
       print(f"Error sending email: {e}")
   finally:
       server.quit()
   ```
